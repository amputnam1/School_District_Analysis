# School_District_Analysis

# Overview 
The main purpose of this project was to review the performance of high schools in a given school district, based on the math and reading scores of their students on standardized tests. Two separate CSVs, one recording information about the various high schools, and another about all of the high school students in the district, were reviewed, cleaned, and then combined prior to being subject to various analyses.

The initial analysis consisted of a per school overview of student population, budget, per-student budget, average math & reading scores, and percentage of students with passing grades. This was also accompanied by a rating of the top-five and bottom-five performing schools, determined by the overall passing percentage of students at these schools.

# Results

Each of the seven school distric metrics were affecgted by the changes in the data. When beginning to review the data from the top five and bottom five of the overall percent of students who had the passing test scores it appeared that the charter schools did better than the district schools. In other words, the charter schools also had lower student populars and had suprior test scores to their counter parts in the district schoosl.

Then, when looking at the data again and how the spending and average test scores relate it appears that schools with more allocated money had more negative student performance.

In reviewing the school data and comparing the performance of studetnts and the school size it's clear that spending per student corelates to the average tests scores or students with passing grades.  Also, the data shows us that when looking at the school type scores the percentages were higher for charter shools compared to those of district schools. 


# Summary

There were four changes to the school district analysis after reading and math scores have been replaced. Through the deep analysis of the data it can be inferred that student perfortmance is not impacted by funding or the type of school. However, it's clear through the data that the school size, and students receiving one on one support and attention from teachers or other academic support impacts student success.
